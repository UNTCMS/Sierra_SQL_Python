# Sierra_SQL_Python
Repository of python/SQL queries for III Sierra record clean up. 

Includes the SQL query and another file of the python version of the query.

## Python Notes:

Each python file refers to the postgresql_password.py file, which will need to be updated with your Sierra password. 

In addition, the following changes will need to be made:

	report = *create your own file path*

	query = *you may need to change the names of local coding for your local codes names*

	conn = *change the host, port, database, and user to your institution's information* (password is stored in the previously-mentioned file and will not need updating in each python file)

You can run these with IDLE (python) program or use the command line (use the python_code_verifications.txt)

python_code_verifications.txt includes the names of all of these files in a way you can highlight all of them, copy, paste into the command line, and then sit back and let everything run. 

You will need to rename files for your local computer; file names cannot have a space in them or the command doesn't work correctly.
  
## SQL Notes:

Summary files show a summary count while the similarly named file shows the Sierra record numbers

Results are formatted so that you can save the query results and easily import into Sierra Create lists without needing to reformat anything.

You may need to make changes to the names of local codes or data.
